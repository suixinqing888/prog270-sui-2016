# Pilates

Pilates is a physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by Joseph Pilates. It is practiced worldwide, and especially in western countries such as Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. As of 2005, there were 11 million people practicing the discipline regularly and 14,000 instructors in the United States.

Pilates called his method "Contrology" (from "control" and Greek -λογία, -logia). Pilates might help to condition the abdominal muscles of healthy people or alleviate lower back pain, but there is no good medical evidence that it is of benefit to people with existing health conditions.
